# Authoring patterns

Canonical, build-clean structures for the most common UI shapes. Adapt
colors and sizes; keep the structure.

## Control CSS (the required minimum)

A control matched by no `<style>` rule is a build error — it would render
blank. Canonical patterns:

```css
/* progressbar */
[role="progressbar"] { position: relative; width: 200px; height: 8px; background: #2e2e42; }
[role="progressbar"] [data-slot="fill"] { height: 100%; background: #7c5cfc; }

/* slider — thumb placement is OWNED by the control: horizontal offset follows
   the value, vertical is auto-centered on the track. Anchor it with
   left:0; top:0 and style size/look only; author top/left/margin positioning
   on the thumb is zeroed at runtime and flagged by check. */
[role="slider"] { position: relative; width: 200px; height: 4px; background: #2e2e42; }
[role="slider"] [data-slot="fill"] { position: absolute; left: 0; top: 0; height: 100%; background: #5fb4d4; }
[role="slider"] [data-slot="thumb"] { position: absolute; left: 0; top: 0; width: 16px; height: 16px; background: #fff; border-radius: 8px; }

/* combobox — structure contract: the selected-value anchor
   (data-slot="value") + the popup (role="listbox") MUST both be
   declared, otherwise FenceMissingControlChild fails the build. The
   runtime writes the selected option's text into the value slot's
   inner text node. */
[role="combobox"] { position: relative; display: flex; flex-direction: row; }
[role="combobox"] [data-slot="value"] { flex-grow: 1; }
[role="combobox"] [role="listbox"] { display: none; position: absolute; left: 0; top: 100%; width: 100%; }
[role="combobox"][aria-expanded="true"] [role="listbox"] { display: flex; flex-direction: column; }
```

`switch` / `radio` have **no framework slot** (no `data-slot="knob"` —
the framework never drives child geometry for these controls; it only
toggles the `aria-checked` state). Visual state lives entirely in CSS via
state selectors. A sliding knob is a child you author plus a
state-selector transform:

```css
[role="switch"] { position: relative; display: flex; width: 40px; height: 20px; background: #2e2e42; }
[role="switch"] .knob { position: absolute; left: 2px; top: 2px; width: 16px; height: 16px; background: #fff; transition: transform .15s; }
[role="switch"][aria-checked="true"] .knob { transform: translateX(20px); }
```

`tree` has no framework slot either — state lives in CSS via the
synthesized `aria-selected` / `aria-expanded` / `aria-level` attributes
(top item = 1; use it for indentation). Put every label (branch and
leaf) in a child `.row` element: a branch hosts its nested items as
block children, so a bare text label trips `FenceMixedInlineBlock`, and
a bare label misses the hover/selected/indent hooks anyway. Hiding
collapsed children is the runtime's job, never author `display:none`:

```css
[role="treeitem"] { display: flex; flex-direction: column; }
[role="treeitem"] .row { display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center; gap: 8px; padding: 8px 12px; }
[role="treeitem"][aria-selected="true"] .row { background: #2e2e42; color: #7c5cfc; }
[role="treeitem"][aria-expanded="true"] .chev { transform: rotate(90deg); }
[role="treeitem"][aria-level="2"] .row { padding-left: 32px; }
```

## Decorated frames (background image behind foreground content)

Rings, campfire circles, portrait frames — the most common trigger of the
mixing rule. The frame is a flex container that centers; the background
image and the foreground content are both flex items:

```html
<div class="actor-frame">
  <img src="../../assets/frames/actor.png" alt="">
  <div class="actor-body">...</div>
</div>
```

```css
.actor-frame { position: relative; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; }
.actor-frame > img { position: absolute; }   /* stretch behind */
```

## Shape masks (circular avatars, diamond/hexagon slots)

Non-rectangular hard-edged clipping is `clip-path` with the fenced basic
shapes — `circle()` and `polygon()`. Declaring it clips the element's own
paint **and** its subtree, and hit testing follows the shape (clipped-away
corners click through), matching browsers:

```css
.avatar { clip-path: circle(50%); }                    /* inscribes a square box */
.slot-diamond {
  clip-path: polygon(50% 0%, 100% 50%, 50% 100%, 0% 50%);
}
.slot-hex {
  clip-path: polygon(25% 0%, 75% 0%, 100% 50%, 75% 100%, 25% 100%, 0% 50%);
}
```

Notes:
- `circle(50%)` resolves its percentage against the box diagonal
  (`sqrt(w^2+h^2)/sqrt(2)`), so on a square box it is the inscribed circle —
  the usual avatar idiom. Position with `at`: `circle(30px at 25% 50%)`.
- `polygon()` percentages resolve against width/height per axis; 3..=16
  points. No `fill-rule` — keep polygons simple (non-self-intersecting).
- Masks stack by intersection with ancestor `overflow:hidden` (like nested
  browser clips). Combos that are build errors: `clip-path` on a scroll
  container (`overflow:scroll/auto`), and clip chains nesting more than 4
  clippers.
- Runtime theming works: swap the mask at runtime via a class rule
  (`StyleSheet.Add` with `clip-path`, or `clip-path: var(--mask)` + `SetVar`).
- Edges are hard (no feathering). Soft/faded masks are a separate deferred
  capability, not expressible today.

## Viewport panning (scroll containers, not Drag events)

Big content in a small viewport — maps, long feeds, panels — is the
`overflow:auto` scroll container. The gesture suite ships with it:
press-drag panning, wheel, inertia, boundary clamping, and
click-after-scroll cancellation. Write **zero drag math**:

```html
<div class="map-scroll">       <!-- overflow:auto — the viewport -->
  <div class="map-layer">      <!-- explicit content size, absolutely
                                  positioned children --> ... </div>
</div>
```

`.map-scroll` typically lives in an elastic flex panel
(`flex-grow:1; min-height:0`) — both are honored at runtime. The
low-level Drag events API is for **object dragging** (title bars,
drag-to-slot), not viewport panning; reaching for it here means
re-implementing what the scroll container already provides.

## Swiping banners / page carousels (scroll-snap)

Discrete pages — onboarding carousels, hero banners, tab strips with
peeking neighbors — are a scroll container plus two declarations.
Write **zero swipe-detection math**:

```html
<style>
.banner { display:flex; flex-direction:row; width:720px; height:300px;
          overflow-x:scroll; scroll-snap-type:x mandatory; }
.page  { width:720px; height:300px; flex-shrink:0;
         scroll-snap-align:start; }   /* start = page-edge aligned; center = iOS-photo style */
</style>
<div class="banner" id="banner">
  <div class="page">1</div><div class="page">2</div><div class="page">3</div>
</div>
```

Rules that matter:

- `scroll-snap-type` needs the axis **and** `mandatory` (`x mandatory`) —
  bare `x` means `proximity` in CSS and is rejected by the fence.
- The snap axis needs `overflow:scroll/auto` on the same element, and at
  least one direct child must declare `scroll-snap-align` — otherwise the
  fence emits a warning and no snapping happens (browser-consistent).
- Physics is built in: crossing 1/3 of a page in the gesture direction
  commits the flip (2/3 against it), a fling flips at the halfway rule and
  never skips pages (one page per gesture), the wheel steps exactly one
  page.

Runtime surface for page indicators and programmatic flips (C#):

```csharp
banner.PageChanged += e => dots[e.PageIndex].Classes.Set("on", true);
banner.ScrollToPage(banner.PageIndex + 1);            // Smooth by default
banner.ScrollToPage(0, ScrollBehavior.Instant);       // jump without tween
```

`PageChanged` settles once per landing (dragging across page boundaries
does not fire per-page; the initial page fires on the first frame, so dot
indicators sync on load).

## Data-driven lists (virtualized)

Declare a blueprint; game code sets `ItemCount` and binds data at runtime:

```html
<div role="list" id="bag-items">
  <template>
    <div role="listitem" class="row">
      <img data-slot="icon" src="../assets/icons/slot.png" alt="">
      <div class="col">
        <span class="name">placeholder</span>
        <span class="count">x0</span>
      </div>
    </div>
  </template>
</div>
```

The list virtualizes automatically — slot count stays constant regardless
of `ItemCount`. Style rows via class selectors scoped under the list; do
not use `:nth-child` here (parked slots skew it), use `[data-index]`.

Mixed row shapes need multiple blueprints — give each `<template>` an
`id`, declare them all under the list, and pick per item in game code
(no auto-collection; see the runtime skill's api-reference for the
strict selector semantics):

```html
<div role="list" id="bag-items">
  <template id="row-tpl">…</template>
  <template id="row-tpl-wide">…</template>
</div>
```
```csharp
var normal = list.GetTemplate("row-tpl");
var wide = list.GetTemplate("row-tpl-wide");
list.TemplateSelector = i => (i % 10 == 0) ? wide : normal;
```

## Staggered entrance

```css
.card { animation: rise .4s both; }
.card:nth-child(3n+1) { animation-delay: .00s; }
.card:nth-child(3n+2) { animation-delay: .08s; }
.card:nth-child(3n+3) { animation-delay: .16s; }
@keyframes rise { from { opacity: 0; transform: translateY(24px); } }
```

Note: text nodes count as children — if delays come out wrong, count
every child.

## Shared design tokens across pages and components

Component style walls mean page CSS cannot style component internals. To
share tokens, author one external CSS and reference it from both sides
(each scope applies it independently):

```html
<!-- page: ui/game/main.html -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="../../shared/tokens.css">
<!-- component: ui/game/components/actor-card.html -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="../../../shared/tokens.css">
```

## Component behavior in C# (RegisterComponent)

HTML composes a component's *structure* (the `components/` file); C#
owns its *behavior* through a registered subclass — no wrapper-div +
`TryGet` scavenging:

```csharp
class ItemCard : CustomElement
{
    public ItemCard(UIContext ctx, ulong id) : base(ctx, id) { }
    protected override void OnConnected()
    {
        // derived ctor has fully run by now; internals are queryable here
        Get<Button>("equip").Clicked += OnEquip;
    }
    protected override void OnDisconnected() { /* release caches, counters */ }
    void OnEquip() { /* ... */ }
}
// during setup, before the first Instantiate:
ctx.RegisterComponent("item-card", (c, id) => new ItemCard(c, id));
```

Every `<item-card>` host — page-static or dynamically instantiated —
constructs `ItemCard` and fires `OnConnected` (after the ctor; eager
at `Instantiate`, or on first observation for lazily materialized
wrappers). `Dispose` and Rust-side removals (list slot rebinding,
external `remove_node`) fire `OnDisconnected` (override for cleanup;
the wrapper is `IsDisposed` afterwards). Registration must precede
instantiate — late registration only affects future constructions;
re-registering a tag throws `UIContractException`. The factory
delegate keeps construction reflection-free (IL2CPP/AOT-safe). Full
contract: api-reference "Custom elements".

## Styling component internals from the page (::part)

Component style walls keep page CSS out of component internals. When a
page needs to adjust one visual inside a component the author did not
parameterize, mark the node with `part` in the component file and
target it with `::part()` in the page:

```html
<!-- component: ui/game/components/actor-card.html -->
<span class="ac-name" part="name">...</span>

<!-- page: ui/game/main.html -->
<style>
  /* only the actor cards in the vip section get golden names */
  .vip .actor-card::part(name) { color: #f39c12; }
</style>
```

Semantics: the compound before `::part` matches the component **host**
(give it a class in page markup); `::part(name)` matches nodes with
`part="name"` inside that host — one level only (nested components'
internals are not reachable; the component author must relay them).
Prefer custom properties (`--*` + `var()`) for theme-wide tokens and
`::part()` for one-off local overrides — `::part()` is the sanctioned
wall-piercing channel for page rules; do not drop the prefix (a bare
`::part(name)` hits that part in every component).
